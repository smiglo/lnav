.SH NAME
lnav \- ncurses-based log file viewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lnav 
[\-hVsar] [logfile1 logfile2 ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The log file navigator, lnav, is an enhanced log file viewer that
takes advantage of any semantic information that can be gleaned from
the files being viewed, such as timestamps and log levels.  Using this
extra semantic information, lnav can do things like interleaving
messages from different files, generate histograms of messages over
time, and providing hotkeys for navigating through the file.  It is
hoped that these features will allow the user to quickly and
efficiently zero in on problems.
